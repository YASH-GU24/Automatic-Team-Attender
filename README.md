# Automatic-Team-Attender
Due to covid 19 most of the work is getting shifted to online
means. There are various online meetings that are boring and
hardly needs attention but your presence needs to be there. So i
made an automated script to attend those MS teams meetings.
You just need to specify link,join time,leave time and the script
will automatically make you join and leave.

As this script uses pyautogui module which clicks on images by seaching them on screen, This script may require some modification in images according to the images/icons that are being displayed on user screen

This script uses chrome to first open the url of the link and then open ms teams through it


Just run the frontend.py ,put the links and timings and then start, it will automatically leave and join the meetings as given
